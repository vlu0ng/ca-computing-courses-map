Type,Code,Course Title,Course Description
GE,2451,Computer Programming,"This course covers the principles and programming styles used in the design and implementation of contemporary programming languages. Students are introduced to the history of programming languages, language syntax and formal grammars, language processors such as compilers and interpreters, and generalized parsing strategies. The course focuses on particular language constructs and their realization in a variety of programming languages. A particular language such as C, BASIC, or Pascal is used to provide students with practical illustrations of various programming principles."
GE,2453,Computer Science,"A generalized computer course that acquaints students with problem-solving methods, algorithm development, structured programming, and modular system design. Students are taught about abstract data structures, techniques for data manipulation and other fundamental concepts, such as recursion. Computer coding and program structure are often introduced using BASIC or another computer language such as C or Pascal. The course may provide opportunities to apply the learned skills to relevant applications, such as modeling, data management, graphics, and text processing. Students learn about computer organization, from digital logic and microprogramming through machine and assembly language."
GE,2458,Other Computer Education,This designation is for any computer education course not identified in the series of courses outlined in the CALPADS Course Group State codes.
GE,2465,IB Computer Science,"Offered at two levels, Computer Science explores the operation of computer systems and the principle underlying problem solving by using computers. In addition to problem solving and programming, students study the structure and design of computer architecture; data representation and logic; and the connecting processes involving operating systems, interfacing, and networking. At both levels, the course demands both logical discipline and imaginative creativity in the selection and design of algorithms and in the writing, testing, and debugging of programs using a high level, block structured language."
GE,2470,AP Computer Science A,"Computer Science A emphasizes object oriented programming methodology with a concentration on problem solving and algorithm development and is meant to be the equivalent of a first semester college level course in Computer Science. It also includes the study of data structures, design, and abstraction, but these topics are not covered to the extent that they are in Computer Science AB."
GE,2472,AP Computer Science Principles,"The AP Computer Science Principles course is designed to be equivalent to a first-semester introductory college computing course. In this course, students will develop computational thinking vital for success across all disciplines, such as using computational tools to analyze and study data and working with large data sets to analyze, visualize, and draw conclusions from trends. The course is unique in its focus on fostering student creativity. Students are encouraged to apply creative processes when developing computational artifacts and to think creatively while using simulations to explore questions that interest them. They will also develop effective communication and collaboration skills, working individually and collaboratively to solve problems, and discussing and writing about the importance of these problems and the impacts to their community, society, and the world."
CTE,4601,Computer Operations / Computer Science,"This instructional program prepares individuals to understand and apply systems and programming concepts to business, including any combination of the following and similar tasks: design algorithm solutions; coordinate the preparation and operations of peripheral equipment systems; design programs with defined user interface, code, execute, test and debug components; develop programs using abstract data types and object-oriented programs; create structured programs in various languages using control structures, procedures, functions, parameters, variables, error recovery and recursion; develop programs that access and modify databases using various file access methods; design hardware and software systems for electronic communication."
CTE,4616,Computer Programming and Game Design,"This course explores the history, art, and science of the game development process through hands on projects using a wide range of software. Students work in teams to design and program their own custom games in class, in both 2D and 3D environments. The course examines 3D modeling, 2D animation, level design, sound effects, player psychology, mathematics for gaming, and game logic/programming."
CTE,4619,Computer Programming for Solving Applied Problems,"This course introduces students how a computer programming controls robots in an integrated development environment through computer programming. To control the robot, students use critical thinking, problem solving, effective communication, and teamwork. This course emphasizes object-oriented programming methodology with a concentration on problem solving and algorithm development."
CTE,4631,Database Design and SQL Programming,"This two-part course teaches data modeling and Structured Query Language (SQL). In the database design curriculum, students learn to analyze complex business scenarios and create a data model, a conceptual representation of an organization's information. In the database programming with SQL curriculum, students implement their database design by creating a physical database using SQL, the industry-standard database programming language. Upon completion of this course, students have the opportunity to take an exam to earn the industry certification Oracle Database SQL Certified Expert."
CTE,4640,CTE AP Computer Science Principles,"Taught by a Career Technical Education (CTE) authorized teacher, the CTE AP Computer Science Principles course is designed to be equivalent to a first-semester introductory college computing course. In this course, students will develop computational thinking vital for success across all disciplines, such as using computational tools to analyze and study data and working with large data sets to analyze, visualize, and draw conclusions from trends.
